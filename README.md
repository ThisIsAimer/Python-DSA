"# Java-DSA" 
Notes:
1. An abstract data type is the data type/class you create on your own! it may contain variables and methods.
// An abstract method is a method that you have to Define after you inharit it or override as ananomous inner class.

2. In java there is no easy way to append a normal array. Unless you are using an array list!


Big O Notation
1) space complexity- algorithms which make space more efficient
2) Time complexity- algorithms that make time more efficient

**different types of Big O notations

O(1)-> constant speed
O(n)-> speed of performing operations take time according to how many elements there are
O(log n)-> speed of the performance will go up at a log2 amount of operations

The searches!
1) linear search = tries to match all the elements of an array with the target element from first to last and returns the index or if its not present then it tells us.
2) binary search = for a sorted array with ascending or descending values, it searches the middle value. If the middle value is not the target then checks if the value given is smaller or greater and repeats this algorythm till it finds the value.
